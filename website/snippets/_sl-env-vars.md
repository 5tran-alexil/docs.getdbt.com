Use [Extended Attributes](/docs/dbt-cloud-environments#extended-attributes) and [Environment Variables](/docs/build/environment-variables) when connecting to the Semantic Layer. If you set a value directly in the Semantic Layer Credentials, it will have a higher priority than Extended Attributes. When using environment variables, the default value for the environment will be used.
